Ok I don't actually suck at wordle. I just wanted to be better.

# what is wordle?
a fun online word puzzle game. check it out over at https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/

# what is this repo?
this repo contains both a small wordle clone `cargo run --bin player` and then a wordle solver `cargo run --bin solver`. 

# how do i use it?
Just run the solver and follow the on screen instructions. Everything is done through text input. NOTE: if you dont follow the on-screen instructions as theyre written the program will probably crash. I didnt error check user input all that much
No I dont plan on making a gui, I wrote this in a day because I was frustrated with the game.

# is it any good?
It's pretty average. In my tests it seems to average a solve in 4 tries. I've never seen it fail to solve a word. Better hueristics would probably lead to better solves. Or some weird ML stuff who knows.
